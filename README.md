# ETL-Data-Pipeline-using-Python-and-SQL
Built an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline in Python to process and load employee data into a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline extracts data from a CSV file using pandas, handles data cleaning such as missing values and duplicates, and loads the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL table using SQLAlchemy. This project demonstrates core ETL concepts, database connectivity via psycopg2, and efficient data handling using Python libraries.
